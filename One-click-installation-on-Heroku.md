Okta is preconfigured and optimised to run securely on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). The Hobby account is cheap at \$7/pm per server if running constantly.

## Warning
Heroku instances are too slow to handle more than a handful of coins at once. You should:

- keep the number of coins you track as low as possible (particularly making sure you only track one BTC/Fiat pair, which have the highest volume)
- or avoid server-side ("soft") orders, since there is a good chance they will trigger too late if the server is lagging
- or avoid Heroku.

## Installation

To instantly deploy your own instance of the application, just click the button below. The Heroku installer will talk you through the process.

To deploy the last **stable release**:

[![Deploy to Heroku](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/gruelbox/orko/tree/stable)

To deploy the latest **development snapshot**:

If that doesn't work, or you don't trust it, you can [install the application manually](Manual-installation-on-Heroku).

## Complete security setup

Your application is not fully secure yet.  Feel free to play with it, but don't add your API keys and play with real money until you have [completed the security setup](Enable-two-factor-authentication).

## Add your API keys

Once your application is secure, you can now set up the following environment variables to start trading against your exchange accounts.
