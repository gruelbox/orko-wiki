# Crossover Trader (V1.2)

This is meant as a full example that uses many of the script engine's features. This implementation will be updated as new features are added to the script engine.

Crossover Trader is a simple automatic trader that buys or sells the selected trading pair when two moving averages of different lengths cross eachother. Crossover Trader is a simple buy/sell automatic trader based either Simple Moving Averages [SMA](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sma.asp) or Exponential Moving Averages [EMA](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ema.asp). 

In the chart below the SMA(12) and SMA(26) are plotted (technically its SMMA in the image, but its just for illustration purpose), and the crossover points indicate where the Crossover Trader would place trades.

You specify the lengths of the fast (i.e SMA(12)) and slow averages (SMA(26)) and the interval at which to sample the price.

For instance

|  Parameter | Value |
|------------|-------|
|interval | 5 |
|algorithm | SMA |
|fast average| 12 |
|slow average| 26 |

In the example above the current price will be sampled every 5 minutes an each of these samples will be fed to the slow and fast simple moving averages (SMA). Since the fast moving average has a smaller length it is more responsive to changes in the market and this moves 'faster'. If the fast average crosses above the slow average a 'BUY' order is issued since the market is trending upwards. If the fast average crosses below the slow averages a 'SELL' order is issued since the market is trending downwards. The orders are currently set as limit orders at the current price so they should (partially) imitate market orders.
 
The algorithm will continue trading until cancelled.

### Engine Features Used

Here are the features of the script engine that are used and for what

- setInterval - Used to create its own periodic ticker (set from initial configuration) from the last trade (setTick) data
- setTick - Used to get a stream of trades for the selected trading pair
- setBalance - Used to know what balances are available for the base and quote side of the selected trading pair
- setOpenOrders - Used to determine is we have an order pending on the exchange

### Input Parameters
The following are the  input parameters for the script. If you are going to use this script please create these variables.

|  Name | Description | Default | Required |
|--------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| intervalSize | Interval (in minutes) to to take each sample | 5 | Yes |
| fastAverageLength | Length of fast average. Needs to be smaller than slow average.| 12 | Yes |
| slowAverageLength | Length of slow average. Needs to be larger than fast average | 26 | Yes |
| algorithm | Algorithm for Moving Average (SMA or EMA) | EMA | Yes |

The _intervalSize_ defines an interval at which a ticker is created internally to tracker the price at the defined interval. The _fastAverageLength_ and _slowAverageLength_ define the number of ticks from the ticker defined by the _intervalSize_. Since there is no current access to history data in the script it you need to wait for the moving averages to fill up before they can be used. This time is the _intervalSize_ * _[fast|slow]AverageLength_ so since the defaults are 5, 12 & 26, this means you need to wait 5 minutes * 12 samples for the fast average and 5 minutes * 26 samples for the slow average so be careful what you set these to as it will take a while to be ready.

Here is Crossover Trader configuration with the default values.

Here is what you can expect from the Server Notifications. The trades themselves are highlighted and updates to the SMA values are provided at each interval.

### Potential Future Improvements

- Add the ability to pre-load history so you don't need to wait for averages to be filled
- Add the ability to call SMA, EMA (and other) algorithms directly from a financial package like in the chart window instead of 
having to reimplement them.
- Offer Market orders so fullfillment is guarenteed 
- Loss Protection - Limit amount of initial capital that can be lost, otherwise exit algorithm
- Investment Limitation - Limit amount of counter/quote currency that can be used for trading 
- Make Algorithm type dropdown selectable instead of being typed in

### Known Issues

- Cancelling the job still leaves subscriptions running (engine problem or script problem?)

### Version History

|  Version | Changes  |
|----------|----------|
| 1.0 | EMA Support - Added support for Exponential Moving Average |
|     | InTrade Detection - Checks the balances of both currencies of the selected trading pair to determine which side of the trade you are on |
| 1.1 | Balance Support - Looks at your balance of each currency in the selected trading pair to see what funds are available |
| 1.2 | SMA Support (Fixed amount traded, requires manual initial inTrade status as Parameter) |
