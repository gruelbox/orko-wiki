## How ready is it for use?

Orko is in active daily use by me, in production. I rely on it for most of my day-to-day spot trading, so that indicates my level of confidence. However:

- You will notice there are lot of [known bugs](../issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abug). Please use with caution and [report](../issues/new/choose) any issues you find. This doesn't stop me using it, but I do often find myself restarting the server or working around known issues.
- There are also some outstanding [security issues](../issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Asecurity), although nothing too serious. That said, since the code has had no third-party review yet, it's highly likely that there are serious issues which have not yet been reported. Similarly, there are likely to be exploits which only now will get attention.
- At the moment, this is a labour of love project for **just one person**. The world of crypto moves fast, and most of the time that means it moves faster than I do. It is commonplace for a change to happen on an exchange which breaks Orko and this can take time to resolve. **Make sure you always have a backup option**, usually in the form of your exchange's own apps, so that you can trade while issues are resolved, and **please be respectful** of the fact that this is being done entirely in my spare time.
- Orko is built on top of the [XChange](https://github.com/knowm/XChange) and [xchange-stream](https://github.com/bitrich-info/xchange-stream) open source libraries, and often these sorts of issues have to be resolved there first. This extra hurdle can make issues take even longer to resolve.
