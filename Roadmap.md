- Improving [security](../issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Asecurity) in a number of ways.
- Improving browser support (currently only tested on Chrome Desktop and Chrome Mobile)
- Improving [mobile UI](../issues/21) for "thumbability".

- Bring Bitmex and Kraken support up to production strength, and support more exchanges
